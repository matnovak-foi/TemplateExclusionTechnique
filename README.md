The TemplateExclusionTechnique system was built as part of PhD thesis entitled 
"Effect of source-code preprocessing techniquers on plagiarsim detection accuracy in 
student programming assignments"
                                                       
The TemplateExclusionTechnique is integrated into the MPC system but it can be used as a standalone technique to
exclude template code from student files.
